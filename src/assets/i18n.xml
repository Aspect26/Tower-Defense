        <s1l1i value="War! Hordes of Glaqnax warriors have appeared on the western shores of Qar kingdom. They sacked most of the seaside villages and started to assemble their forces near The First Gates to the kingdom. Stop them before they reach it!" />
		<s1l2i value="Although you were successful in defending The First Gates on the western walls from the enemy, they were only a decoy. A new group of enemies has appeared on the other side of the island. You have to quickly build new defenses on the eastern shore. Shall they breach the wall, we will not be able to quickly form our militia and call allies for help." />
		<s1l3i value="The allies have come just in time! We have held off the enemy forces, at least for now. A massive fleet has appeared on the horizon during the night. They must have come here only for one reason. Demolish everything that stands in their way. But we do not run! We do NOT surrender. This is our home, and we will fight for it until we win, or there is noone to fight for! There is still time to reinforce our defenses. Build as much towers as possible until the enemy fleet reaches our land." />
